    """
    Compute the Maximum Leiden Adjusted Mutual Info (MLAMI). The MLAMI ranges
    between '0' and '1' with higher values indicating that the latent feature
    space more accurately preserves global spatial organization from the spatial
    (ground truth) feature space. To compute the MLAMI, Leiden clusterings with
    different resolutions are computed for both nearest neighbor graphs. The
    Adjusted Mutual Info (AMI) between all clustering resolution pairs is
    computed to quantify cluster overlap and the maximum value is returned as
    metric for spatial organization preservation.

    If a ´batch_key´ is provided, the MLAMI will be computed on each batch
    separately (with latent Leiden clusters computed on the integrated latent
    space), and the average across all batches is returned.

    If existent, uses precomputed nearest neighbor graphs stored in
    ´adata.obsp[spatial_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ and
    ´adata.obsp[latent_knng_key + '_connectivities']´.
    Alternatively, computes them on the fly using ´spatial_key´, ´latent_key´
    and ´n_neighbors´, and stores them in 
    ´adata.obsp[spatial_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ and
    ´adata.obsp[latent_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata:
        AnnData object with precomputed nearest neighbor graphs stored in
        ´adata.obsp[spatial_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ and

        stored in ´adata.obsm[spatial_key]´ and the latent representation from a
        model stored in ´adata.obsm[latent_key]´.
    batch_key:
        Key under which the batches are stored in ´adata.obs´. If ´None´, the
        adata is assumed to only have one unique batch.
    spatial_knng_key:
        Key under which the spatial nearest neighbor graph is / will be stored
        in ´adata.obsp´ with the suffix '_connectivities'.

        Key under which the latent nearest neighbor graph is / will be stored in
        ´adata.obsp´ with the suffix '_connectivities'.
    spatial_key:
        Key under which the spatial coordinates are stored in ´adata.obsm´.
    latent_key:
        Key under which the latent representation from a model is stored in
        ´adata.obsm´.
    n_neighbors:
        Number of neighbors used for the construction of the nearest neighbor
        graphs from the spatial coordinates and the latent representation from
        a model in case they are constructed.
    min_res:
        Minimum resolution for Leiden clustering.
    max_res:
        Maximum resolution for Leiden clustering.
    res_num:
        Number of linearly spaced Leiden resolutions between ´min_res´ and
        ´max_res´ for which Leiden clusterings will be computed.
    n_jobs:
        Number of jobs to use for parallelization of neighbor search.
    seed:
        Random seed for reproducibility.

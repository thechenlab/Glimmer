    """
    Compute the Cell Type Affinity Similarity (CAS). The CAS measures how
    accurately the latent nearest neighbor graph preserves cell-type-pair edges
    from the spatial (ground truth) nearest neighbor graph. A value of '1'
    indicates perfect cell-type-pair similarity and a value of '0' indicates no
    cell-type-pair similarity at all. The CAS is a variation of the Cell Type
    Affinity Distance which was first introduced by Lohoff, T. et al.
    Integration of spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates mouse
    organogenesis. Nat. Biotechnol. 40, 74–85 (2022).
    
    If a ´batch_key´ is provided, separate spatial nearest neighbor graphs per
    batch will be computed and are then combined as disconnected components by
    padding with 0s.
    
    If existent, uses precomputed nearest neighbor graphs stored in
    ´adata.obsp[spatial_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ and
    ´adata.obsp[latent_knng_key + '_connectivities']´.
    Alternatively, computes them on the fly using ´spatial_key´, ´latent_key´
    and ´n_neighbors´, , and stores them in
    ´adata.obsp[spatial_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ and
    ´adata.obsp[latent_knng_key + '_connectivities']´ respectively.
    
    Note that the used neighborhood enrichment implementation from squidpy
    slightly deviates from the original method and we construct nearest neighbor
    graphs using the original spatial coordinates and the latent representation
    from a model respectively to compute the similarity. The cell type affinity
    matrices, also called cell-cell contact (ccc) maps are stored in the AnnData
    object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata:
        AnnData object with cell type annotations stored in
        ´adata.obs[cell_type_key]´, precomputed nearest neighbor graphs stored

        graphs from the spatial coordinates and the latent representation from
        a model in case they are constructed.

        Number of permutations used for the neighborhood enrichment score
        calculation.

    Returns
    ----------
    cas:
        Matrix similarity between the latent cell type affinity matrix and the
        spatial (ground truth) cell type affinity matrix (or
        batch-aggregated spatial cell type affinity matrices) as measured by
        one minus the size-normalied Frobenius norm of the element-wise matrix
        differences.
